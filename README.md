# ACS_Drug_Discovery_Transcriptomics
Transcriptomic drug discovery analysis for Acute Coronary Syndrome using BioJupies.

Project Overview:

This project focuses on the application of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) to identify molecular pathways and genetic variants associated with cardiovascular diseases. This opportunity was provided by Open Avenues: The Build Foundation and led by Dr. Yanling Wang, Research Scientist at FireCyte Therapeutics. The primary objective was to utilize high-throughput sequencing data to understand the transcriptomic or genomic changes that drive heart disease, bridging the gap between computational biology and clinical therapeutic development.

How is it done?

Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing

Non-coding RNA profiling by high throughput sequencing

9 participants:

Control Group:

-3 healthy individuals with no CAD (confirmed with angiography)

SA Group (3) (Stable Angina):

-chest pain or discomfort that often occurs with activity or emotional stress. Poor blood flow through the blood vessels.

ACS Group (3) – (Acute Coronary Syndrome):

-a group of conditions that can suddenly reduce or stop blood flow to the heart. Damaging the heart from plaque rupture, clot formation, & atherosclerosis (hardening and narrowing the arteries.)

Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC) – type of blood cell that includes lymphocytes (T cells and B cells) and monocytes. Significance in studying immune responses and disease mechanisms

Blood samples were taken from all groups, and PBMCs were isolated. The total RNA was extracted from the samples and checked for quality. 1 microgram of RNA, mRNA was removed using a RiboZero Magnetic Gold Kit, and The KAPA Stranded RNA-Seq Library Prep Kit was used to prepare for seqencing as stated in the study.

Why was it done?

-Study of the gene expression patters in blood cells from people with different heart conditions.

Conclusion:

-This study analyzed the gene expression profiles of blood cells from 9 patients. Isolating the PBMS’s and sequenced their RNA to understand the molecular differences associated with Stable Agina and Acute Coronary Syndrome compared to healthy individuals.

Analysis:

P. Value – the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis. Being no difference in expression levels of a gene between groups compared. Low P. Value -less than 0.05 indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis. Implying that the gene is differentially expressed between the groups. High P.Value – greater than 0.05 suggests weak evidence against the null hypothesis, implying that the observed differences could be due to random chance.
